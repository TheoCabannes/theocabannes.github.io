<!-- Add a picture of me on the side -->

My early career has been shaped by my passions for system engineering, urban planning and computer science as much as it has been shaped by the incredible people I have had the chance to meet.
I am currently a research scientist at a fintech startup created by Steven Levitt, where I am using my knowledge in machine learning, data analysis, and optimization to improve our knowledge of human behaviors in markets.
Previously, I was optimizing Google Maps routing suggestions to make road transportation safer, faster, and more sustainable.

Curiosity-driven, I am amazed by large-scale systems resulting from human interactions.
This led me to performed a computer science Ph.D. between UC Berkeley and Ã‰cole Polytechnique about the impact that information-aware routing has on metropolitan road traffic.
Previously, I did a master in urban planning to better understand how cities are designed, and I did a master in applied maths to learn the tools to analyze and optimize large-scale systems.
During my sparse time, I enjoy visiting new places, meeting new people, and learning and discovering new things.

I believe that there are billions ways to make the world a better place.
I believe that we need everyone expertise to design systems that serve communities and that help understanding the world.
My expertise lies between optimization, machine learning, statistics (Stata), back-end development (C++, python), research, and teaching.
I am happy to contribute to any project where I can be useful. Free free to send me an email to theophile.cabannes@gmail.com.
